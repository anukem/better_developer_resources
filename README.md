# Better Developer Resources

This originally started as a repo for my varied interests, but I thought it
would be more interesting to create more knowledge sharing across the board for any new
developers.

Currently there is:
* web_dev for all things web related
* software_engineering for all the useful swe practices you've developed or found useful
* interview_questions for the perennial interview to get to that next level
* git for well.... git stuff


Feel free to submit pull requests to any or all or none of these, but I hope you find it beneficial!
