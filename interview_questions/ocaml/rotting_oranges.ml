(* In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values: *)
(*  *)
(* the value 0 representing an empty cell; *)
(* the value 1 representing a fresh orange; *)
(* the value 2 representing a rotten orange. *)
(* Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten. *)
(* Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead. *)
